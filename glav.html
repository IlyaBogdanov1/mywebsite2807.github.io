In economic terms,it provides country's internal development. Our contribution is also essential. In the past few years, Belarus has been involved in United Nations peace-keeping operations promoting international peace and security.
</br> <br>After gaining independence in 1991. Belarus paid a lot of attention to its foreign policy Our country has become a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), NATO's Partnership for Peace (PiP), the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPc), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Bank.</br><br> Belarus maintains diplomatic relations with 177 countries of the world and is represented today by foreign offices in 59 states. In 2014 it opened embassies in Australia, Qatar, Mongolia, Pakistan and Ecuador 2016 - in Georgia and Spain. Foreign states are represented in Belarus by 45 embassies, 4 branch offices of embassies, 35 consular offices.</br><br> Another way of international cooperation is creating twin towns and sister cities between countries to establish cultural and commercial ties. This form of social agreement encourages friendship between different cultures and increases tourism. Belarus has a great number of twin towns and sister cities in different parts of the world. And towns and cities of Great Britain are among them. Minsk and Nottingham twin towns since 1957, Brest and Aberdeen (Scotland) since 1990.</br><br> It should be mentioned that Belarus receives more and more popularity on the international arena. Minsk hosted Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2010 which took place in the Cultural and Sport Complex Minsk Arena. And in 2014 our capital drew crowds again due to the Ice Hockey World ChampionshipThe main venues were Minsk Arena and Chizhovka Arena. Where do you think 2019 European Games will be held? Right, in Minsk.</br> <br>Our country is also renowned for the International Festival of Arts "Slavyansky Bazaar". It is held annually in Vitebsk. Once started a local festival of Slavonic song folklore, it became international in 1995 and continues broadening the geography of its participants ge more important international event held in Belarus is worth mentioning, namely Belarus Fashion Week. Its value lies in the popularisation of Belarusian pret-a porter designer clothes. Due to this project Belarusian fashion is recognised abroad.</br><br> To conclude, I should say that modern Belarus is a sovereign European state with a peaceful foreign policy. lIts government does its best to develop cooperation with foreign partners from all over the world. Moreover, our country contributes a lot to strengthening international security and stability.</br></font></center></h1>
