<p><center><br/><br/><br/><font size="5" face="Verdana"> Advices to your friend who is hosting a foreign student. Hosting foreign students is a unique opportunity to find out more about other cultures and to find new friends from all around the world! But there are some relevant points which you should bear in mind if you decide to host a foreign student. First of all, make him /her feel welcome by introducing to your friends and family. It may sound strange but engaging your guest in the household chores will let him/her be part of the family. Secondly,think of the activities which can be interesting for your guest and will make his/her stay in Belarus unforgettable. Thirdly, it will be a good idea to learn about the social etiquette in the exchange student's country. it can help to avoid awkward situations.</font>
